# Game Store Point of Sale: Administrative Portal

## Description
This is an administrative portal that I created for a point of sale system. The portal accesses a hosted database that I created to handle login, registration, inventory management, etc. I used a bootstrap template and a couple small snipets of code from online articles (see "code" section below), but everthing else here -- including all PHP code -- is my own personal work. 

## Demo
I've hosted the portal [here](http://treksoftware.org/POS/src/). You can use my sample credentials (email: jed34@njit.edu, password: "password") to login and explore the website.

## Code

### Frontend
I used a free bootstrap template called "Gentelella Alela!" by Colorlib, licensed under the MIT license (included). The original template can be found [here](https://github.com/puikinsh/gentelella). It uses JQuery, Chart.js, and animate.css among other libraries for styling and functionality.

### Backend
I created an online MySQL database and wrote PHP to access, retrieve, and upload data to it (the config.ini file containing login information is not included in this repository). I used parts of the login code snippet found [here](http://www.codingcage.com/2015/01/user-registration-and-login-script-using-php-mysql.html) to get started, and I also used the PHP functionality [here](https://www.binpress.com/tutorial/using-php-with-mysql-the-right-way/17) to make a connection with the database. 

## History
